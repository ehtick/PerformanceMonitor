/// Drift guard between the gated-live CI cluster's hand-written <c>postgresql.conf</c> settings and the
/// product's own worker sizing, <see cref="PerformanceMonitor.Darling.Service.DarlingManagedPostgres"/>'s
/// <c>BuildWorkerSizingConfAppend</c> (#1888).
///
/// <para><b>Why this exists.</b> The throwaway cluster in <c>build.yml</c>'s <c>darling-pg</c> job and its
/// <c>nightly.yml</c> mirror is stood up by shell, not by the product, so it got PostgreSQL's default
/// <c>max_worker_processes = 8</c> — the exact under-provisioned shape the product exists to avoid. Every
/// TimescaleDB background policy (compression, retention, continuous-aggregate refresh) is launched by a
/// background worker, and at 8 slots those launches routinely fail outright ("failed to start a background
/// worker"), so a large part of what the product does in the field was exercised only by the tests' explicit
/// foreground <c>run_job</c> calls. Measured on this repo's pg-runtime, same cluster, only that setting
/// changed: <c>add_compression_policy</c> over three eligible chunks compressed NOTHING in six seconds at 8
/// (the job never launched, <c>total_runs</c> NULL) and all three at 64.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Why a parse rather than a constant.</b> A workflow cannot call into the product, so the two
/// numbers have to be literals in YAML — and literals derived from the collector catalog go stale the moment a
/// collector is added. That is not hypothetical: <see cref="DarlingManagedPostgresTests"/> carried a hard "40"
/// pin from the 27-hypertable era and it went stale exactly that way, which is why the product's own test
/// derives instead. This reads the REAL workflow files (copied beside the test binary by the csproj, so there
/// is no second copy to go stale) and requires both numbers to equal what
/// <see cref="TimescaleSupport.HypertableCount"/> produces today. Add a collector and this fails on the pull
/// request that adds it, naming the file and the number to change.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The guard is itself guarded.</b> <see cref="ParsedSettings_Comparison_FailsOnAnInjectedDrift"/>
/// runs the identical parse over a mutated copy and asserts it reports the difference, so a regex that
/// silently matched nothing — a reformatted <c>Add-Content</c>, a renamed step — can never pass as "no
/// drift". A guard whose parser has stopped matching is indistinguishable from a clean one by its result
/// alone, and that is precisely the failure mode this whole family of source-parsing tests exists to catch.</para>
