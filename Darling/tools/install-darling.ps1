<#
.SYNOPSIS
Installs (or upgrades) the PerformanceMonitor Darling service from the folder this script sits in,
and creates Desktop + Start Menu shortcuts for the bundled viewer.

.DESCRIPTION
Run from an ELEVATED PowerShell, from the folder you extracted the Darling zip into (the script
installs the service pointing at THAT folder — extract to the final location first, e.g.
C:\PerformanceMonitorDarling). What it does, in order:

  1. Verifies elevation, the service exe, and darling.json (offers to copy darling.sample.json
     and stops so you can edit it — the service is not installed with an unedited sample).
  2. Optional pre-flight: runs `--test-connection` and shows the per-server PASS/FAIL lines
     (continue-or-abort prompt on failure; -SkipPreflight to skip).
  3. Registers the Windows Event Log source 'PerformanceMonitor Darling' (requires elevation —
     the service's own virtual account cannot; without it Event Log diagnostics are silently
     dropped. The file log under %ProgramData%\PerformanceMonitorDarling\logs works regardless).
  4. Creates the service under the NT SERVICE virtual account (NEVER LocalSystem — the bundled
     PostgreSQL refuses to run with administrative privileges), start=auto. If the service
     already exists this is an UPGRADE: it is stopped and its binPath updated in place; your
     darling.json, store data, and credentials are untouched.
  4b. Restricts darling.json to SYSTEM / Administrators / the service account, plus read for
     INTERACTIVE (the Viewer). It holds encrypted SQL passwords and the MCP/web access tokens,
     and an install folder under C:\ otherwise inherits read access for BUILTIN\Users.
  4c. Creates (or removes) the scoped Windows Firewall rules to match darling.json, via the exe's
     --configure-firewall verb. This requires elevation, which is why it lives here: the service's
     own unprivileged account cannot create them, and only verifies them at runtime.
  5. Starts the service and confirms it reaches Running.
  6. Creates 'Darling Viewer' shortcuts on the Desktop and in the Start Menu pointing at
     viewer\PerformanceMonitor.Darling.Viewer.exe. (Taskbar pinning is deliberately not
     attempted — Windows blocks programmatic pinning by design; pin from the Start Menu entry.)

Uninstall with uninstall-darling.ps1 (same folder).

.PARAMETER SkipPreflight
Skip the --test-connection pre-flight gate.

.PARAMETER NoShortcuts
Do not create the viewer shortcuts.

.PARAMETER Network
After the service reaches Running, launch the interactive --configure-network wizard to opt into the
store / MCP / web-dashboard LAN endpoints (guided, delegated validation, comment-preserving darling.json
edit + backup). Off by default; the endpoints stay loopback-only unless you pass this or edit darling.json
by hand.

# -- 4b. Lock down darling.json (#1647) -----------------------------------------------------------
# The config holds every monitored server's encryptedPassword plus the MCP bearer and web access tokens.
# They are DPAPI LocalMachine scope with an entropy constant that ships in the open-source repo, so READ
# access to this file IS the secret - the ACL is the boundary, the same posture the PG credential files get.
# Extracting the zip to a folder created directly under C:\ (the documented location) inherits
# BUILTIN\Users: Read & Execute from the root DACL, which hands every local user the lot.
#
# Runs AFTER service creation on purpose: the NT SERVICE virtual account has no SID to grant until sc.exe
# create has made it. Mirrors DarlingFileSecurity.HardenFile exactly - SYSTEM / Administrators / the service
# account get full control on both, and INTERACTIVE gets read on the LIVE CONFIG ONLY (the Viewer and the CLI
# verbs run as the interactive operator and must still read darling.json; nothing reads a backup, #1769).
# Best-effort: a failure warns rather than aborting an otherwise good install, and the service re-asserts the
# live config's ACL at every startup.
#
# Covers darling.json AND its .bak-* siblings (#1721). The CLI's config-editing verbs back the file up
# before rewriting it, and File.Copy does NOT carry the source DACL - a backup takes the DIRECTORY's
# inheritable ACEs instead, so on an install under C:\ every past edit left a world-readable copy of the
# same secrets. The service hardens new backups itself now; these are the ones already on disk.
#
# The service account is also made the OWNER, best-effort and in a try of its own. Ownership carries
# WRITE_DAC implicitly, which is what lets the service re-assert this ACL at every start. Granting it
# FullControl below achieves the same thing today; owning the file means it still holds if someone later
# edits the DACL and drops that grant. Done AFTER the DACL and in its own try, so a SeRestorePrivilege
# failure cannot take the DACL down with it - the failure mode we are fixing came from a permissions call
# that silently did nothing.

# simply blocked. Networked is the normal deployment mode, so rule management belongs here, in the elevated
# install, and the running service only verifies.
#
# The exe does the work (--configure-firewall) rather than this script building rules itself: the rule names,
# the ports, and above all WHETHER a surface is really exposed come from the same resolvers the service
# fail-closes on, so a config the service degrades to loopback never gets an open port, and the service's own
# start-up check always reaches the same verdict the installer just acted on. Idempotent, so an upgrade
# re-running it is a no-op, and it needs only darling.json - no store, no credentials - so it is safe here,
