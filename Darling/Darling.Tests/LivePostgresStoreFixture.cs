/// <summary>
/// Establishes the shared <c>DARLING_TEST_PG</c> store ONCE, before the first class in the
/// <c>live-postgres</c> collection runs (#1862). Wired by <see cref="LivePostgresCollection"/>.
///
/// <para><b>The bug this closes.</b> Until now "the store is established" was an EMERGENT property of test
/// order: every live class did its own <see cref="PgMigrations.MigrateAsync"/>, and a class needing
/// TimescaleDB did its own <see cref="TimescaleSupport.TryEnableAsync"/> — so whether the extension existed
/// when a given test ran depended entirely on which class xUnit happened to schedule first. Both are
/// PERSISTENT, database-level changes, so the FIRST class to make them silently established the store for
/// every class after it. <c>PayloadDimensionLiveTests.DimensionGc_DefersWhenAFactFloorIsUnmeasurable_…</c>
/// reads <c>timescaledb_information.continuous_aggregates</c> without enabling the extension itself; run
/// first against a fresh database it died 3-5ms in with <c>42P01</c>, and run after any of its three
/// siblings (which DO enable) it passed. Same test, same code, opposite outcome.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Why that shape is expensive out of proportion to the bug.</b> The failure MOVES. It lands on
/// whichever class drew the short straw this run, so it reads as "the change under test broke something it
/// never touched" and gets re-run rather than fixed — the same cost <see cref="ViewerTimeStaticsCollection"/>
/// and <see cref="LivePostgresCollectionHygieneTests"/> were written to stop. And CI is no help: it builds a
/// throwaway cluster per run, so a green <c>darling-pg</c> job means the scheduling lottery came up good, not
/// that the suite is order-independent.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Why a collection fixture rather than fixing the one test.</b> Adding the missing
/// <c>TryEnableAsync</c> call to that one method would turn this run green and leave the defect in place: the
/// next live class to read a Timescale catalog, or to assume a migrated store, re-opens it, and the next
/// person pays the same diagnosis. xUnit constructs a collection fixture and awaits its
/// <see cref="IAsyncLifetime.InitializeAsync"/> before ANY class in the collection runs, which is exactly the
/// ordering guarantee that was missing. Classes do not need to inject it — the sixty-odd existing
/// <c>[Collection("live-postgres")]</c> classes are unchanged and simply find an established store.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Migrate BEFORE enabling the extension, and that order is load-bearing.</b> It mirrors what the
/// service does on every start (<c>DarlingWorker</c>: migrate, then <c>TryEnableAsync</c>), and the V23
/// migration branches on whether the extension exists — <c>IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_extension WHERE
/// extname = 'timescaledb')</c>. Enabling first would make V23 convert <c>collection_log</c> to a hypertable
/// during migration on a fresh store, which is the UPGRADE path, not the fresh-store path this fixture is
/// standing in for. <c>TimescaleSupportTests</c> reads the fresh-store premise directly ("on a store whose
/// migrations ran BEFORE CREATE EXTENSION (this shared test database, and any fresh managed store) V23's
/// guard skips"), so a reordering here would quietly retire the coverage of the authoritative runtime
/// conversion path.</para>
///
/// <para><b>What it deliberately does NOT do:</b> hypertable conversion, continuous aggregates, retention
/// policies. Those are what the live classes are TESTING — several create and snapshot-restore aggregates,
/// and <c>TimescaleSupportTests</c> asserts on the un-converted starting state. Establishing them here would
/// trade an ordering bug for a fixture that silently answers the questions the tests are asking. Migrate plus
