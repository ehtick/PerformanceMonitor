///
/// <para><b>Ordering alone does not get you there.</b> #1905 walks the policy list and proves every consumer's
/// horizon outlives its source's. That is necessary and not sufficient, because <c>drop_chunks</c> removes only
/// chunks whose WHOLE range is past the cutoff — so actual retention always runs LONGER than nominal, by up to
/// one chunk interval, and by a different amount on each side. Get the geometry wrong and a source can end up
/// holding data older than anything its consumer kept, with both horizons perfectly ordered.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Why this cannot be a unit test.</b> Every number it depends on is the ENGINE's. Materialization
/// hypertables take a chunk interval nobody in this codebase sets, and the rule is not the one people remember.
/// Measured on PostgreSQL 18.4 / TimescaleDB 2.28.1 by moving <see cref="TimescaleSupport.ChunkIntervalDays"/>
/// and re-reading every relation: a materialization hypertable's chunk interval is <b>10x the RAW hypertable's
/// chunk interval</b> — 1 day of raw gives 10 days, 7 days of raw gives 70 — uniformly, at every depth of the
/// hierarchy and regardless of bucket width. It is NOT the widely-repeated "10x the bucket width" (a 1-hour
/// aggregate would then be 10 hours, and it is not), and it does NOT compound down a chain (the three-level
/// day-grain daily reads the same 10x as its parents, not 10x theirs). A C# test can assert what we declare;
/// only a live store can say what the engine chose.</para>
///
/// <para>One consequence is load-bearing and worth stating: because that rule is uniform, EVERY aggregate in
/// this store shares one chunk interval. So aggregate-to-aggregate pairs are always on identical grids, and
