/// <para><b>The defect.</b> A bring-your-own <c>postgres.connectionString</c> carries the documented bare
/// <c>Root Certificate=server.crt</c>, and Npgsql hands that value to the file system as given — so a
/// relative one resolved against the viewer PROCESS's working directory. A desktop shortcut's "Start in", or
/// Explorer's last-used directory, therefore decided which file a <c>VerifyFull</c> pin trusted. That makes
/// the working directory the trust anchor: launched with a working directory an attacker can write
/// (Downloads, a shared folder), a planted <c>server.crt</c> becomes the pinned root, and with LAN position
/// that is interception of the store session and the credential inside it. The anchor is now the directory
/// of the darling.json the viewer actually loaded — the certificate the operator exported BESIDE their
/// config is the certificate that gets pinned, wherever the folder is copied and however the viewer is
/// launched.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Why it is one class with two entry points.</b> Two places have to agree about the resolved path:
/// the connection string that reaches Npgsql (<see cref="Anchor"/>, called from
/// <see cref="ViewerSettings"/>), and the startup diagnostics that promise "the absolute path Npgsql will
/// actually open" (#1954, <see cref="ViewerConfigDiagnostics"/>). A diagnostic that computes its own answer
/// is worse than none once the two drift, so <see cref="Anchor"/> is a thin wrapper over
/// <see cref="Resolve"/> and the diagnostics call <see cref="Resolve"/> directly — there is exactly one
/// implementation of the rule. <c>ViewerConfigDiagnosticsTests</c> pins both the routing and the agreement.</para>
///
/// <para>Pure and total: no process state is read and nothing here throws, because both callers run on the
/// viewer's startup path where an exception is a window that never opens.</para>
