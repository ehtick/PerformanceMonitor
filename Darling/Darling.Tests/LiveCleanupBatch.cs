/// test — and on a PASSING test nobody reads it. So a <c>DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW</c> that lost a race reported
/// success, the aggregate survived into the shared store, and every later test (and on a reused database,
/// every later RUN) inherited it. A stranded aggregate is not inert: it changes compose's tier routing, feeds
/// the #1784 coverage gate, and makes <c>EnsureBaselineFallbackViewsAsync</c> a no-op for whatever it
/// shadows — which is how <c>query_stats_db_hourly</c> and <c>query_stats_db_daily</c> came to persist.</para>
///
/// <para><b>The collision is real, and it was reproduced.</b> Against PostgreSQL 18.4 + TimescaleDB 2.28.1, a
/// <c>refresh_continuous_aggregate</c> running concurrently with a <c>DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW</c> of the same
/// aggregate fails the DROP and LEAVES THE AGGREGATE STANDING, every time it collides. Two different
/// SQLSTATEs came out of the identical setup, depending on which phase of the refresh was in flight:
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><c>40P01</c> deadlock detected — the DROP is chosen as the victim while deleting from
/// <c>continuous_aggs_materialization_invalidation_log</c>, which the refresh wants a lock on.</item>

/// </list></para>
///
/// <para><b>Which is why this retries on ANY failure and lets a PROBE be the judge.</b> A SQLSTATE allow-list
/// is the natural shape and it is the wrong one here: <c>XX000</c> is <c>internal_error</c>, the class you
/// would never put on a retry list, yet it is what a perfectly ordinary refresh collision produces. The
/// postcondition — "the object is gone" — is the only thing that actually needs to be true, so that is what
/// is asserted, and the SQLSTATE never has to be classified at all. It also makes the "it was already gone"

/// that is a success rather than a special case.</para>
///
