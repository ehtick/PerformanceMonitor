/// actually parsed out of it — everything except credentials.
///
/// <para><b>Why this exists.</b> Field reports of "the viewer will not connect" were undiagnosable from the
/// log, because the viewer said neither which of its four candidate config paths it read nor what it got.
/// Two very different faults — reading the WRONG file, and reading the RIGHT file with a wrong value —
/// produced the identical generic failure. The certificate is the sharpest case: the documented
/// bring-your-own connection string carries a bare <c>Root Certificate=server.crt</c>, and a viewer launched
/// from a shortcut and one launched from a shell used to look for that cert in different places, with
/// neither one saying where. #1970 removed the divergence — a relative certificate is anchored to
/// darling.json's own directory — and this block reports the anchored result, through the SAME
/// <see cref="ViewerCertificateAnchor"/> the connection string is rewritten by, so the path it names is the
/// path Npgsql opens rather than a second opinion about it.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Redaction is structural, not careful.</b> The summary is built from an ALLOWLIST of connection-string
/// properties (host, port, username, database, SSL mode, search path, root certificate) read off a parsed
/// <see cref="NpgsqlConnectionStringBuilder"/>. There is no path through this class that copies the caller's
/// connection string into its output, so no key an operator adds later — <c>Password</c>, <c>Passfile</c>, a
/// future credential keyword — can leak by being forgotten. A string that will not parse reports only the
/// exception TYPE for the same reason: an Npgsql parse message can quote the offending fragment.
/// <c>ViewerConfigDiagnosticsTests</c> pins this by feeding a live password through and asserting it never
/// appears in the output.</para>
