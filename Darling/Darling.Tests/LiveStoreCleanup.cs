/// connection. That connection is the one thing the failure being reported may have destroyed — a broken
/// socket, a taint from a failed COPY, a cancellation mid-command all leave it closed — and a cleanup on a
/// closed connection does three bad things at once: it throws
/// <c>InvalidOperationException: Connection is not open</c> from a helper frame (which is exactly the
/// signature #1794 chased), that throw REPLACES the body's in-flight exception (a finally-throw wins, so
/// the real failure is masked), and it abandons every cleanup statement after the first — leaving renames,
/// aggregate snapshots, and dim rows behind in the reused store, which is how one masked failure
/// manufactures the next run's "unrelated" flakes.</para>
///
/// <para>This helper gives cleanup its own freshly-opened connection and its own lifetime:
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><see cref="CancellationToken.None"/>, deliberately — a cancelled test run must still restore the
/// store, and the body's token is by definition already signalled on that path. Statement runtime is
/// bounded by the commands' own timeouts.</item>
/// <item>When the BODY already failed, a cleanup exception is swallowed: the body's exception is the
/// story, and replacing it with cleanup noise is the masking this exists to end. When the body
/// SUCCEEDED, cleanup failures propagate loudly — a cleanup that cannot do its job must not be
/// silent, or the debris problem returns by another door.</item>
